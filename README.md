# science_project_template
template for science file organization

*If you're a member of the CANAL Lab, I strongly recommend you use this template.*

Naming convention for pojects should be:

YYYY_Proj_Code_Researcher

Study year, the project code (make it descriptive, but short - e.g., Biling_NODDI_YA), your full name

e.g., 2022_Biling_NODDI_YA_Imola_MacPhee

to use this template, first install cookiecutter (use pip install cookiecutter on Linux or brew install cookiecutter if on OSX), then from the directory you want to install this project template to, run the following in the terminal:

```cookiecutter https://github.com/johnaeanderson/science_project_template ```
